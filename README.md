SMART REFLECT


PRE-REQUISITES :
 1. Node js,
 2. My-SQL,

HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN :
 1. Installing Dependencies :
        run "npm install" in terminal/cmd root directory to install all the dependencies. If any error occurs use google to solve them.
 2. Configure My-SQL :
        Grab the timetabldb.sql from the root folder and run it, thus creating database. Later grab the host, user and password of your sql server and edit the mysqldb.js in src/db.
 3. Open terminal/cmd in the root folder and run "npm run start". Wait for the confirmation of server. Once the server is running, open the browser and go to url "localhost:3000".
